1.General
    - To create a new Command, install the vs-extension and run 'create-template'-Command
        - Commands that are accessable for everyone are lowerCase
        - Commands that are not accessable like Music should start with a UpperCase letter
    - global.bot saves the Discord.Client
    - global.guilds saves Channels/settings/prefix/Admins, so you dont have to require them everytime -> global.guilds[message.guild.id]['settings']
    - botMain.debug disables readyMessage and BackgroundTasks, so debugging doesnt spam chats


2.FileHandler
    - Any Files you write should be in Files/local/
    - fh.get('../Files/local/counter.json') gives you a Object
    - fh.write('file.json',OBJECT,guildID) 
        -only add the guildID if the File differs from Server to Server
